So what if I add a big image?

### Big image here

{{% figure src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yUgY0TEGce8/UZj5PVYJlFI/AAAAAAAAMew/8xVoxntlVv4/s1600/VFcompany+-+4.jpg" alt="Miyavi is awesome!"%}}

Well, I want it to resize automatically! Done!

Now I'll try using the markdown syntax:

![Michlle Rodriguez is hawt](http://images6.alphacoders.com/466/466111.jpg "Michelle Rodriguez")

I also want images to appear centered:

And finally, it would be cool to have some captions:

{{% img src="http://fms.komkon.org/GameBoy/Tech/Cart2.gif" title="Gameboy MCB1" %}}

And that's all for today kids!

See you another time :)
