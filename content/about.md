I'm a Computer Science student from Barcelona with interests in embedded devices, 
hardware hacking, security and cryptography.

I've been using Linux for nearly 10 years and tried some *BSD along the way. The
main programming languages I use are C and lately Go. I enjoy learning about new
programming languages.
