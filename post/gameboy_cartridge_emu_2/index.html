<p>This post is a continuation of <a href="/post/gameboy_cartridge_emu_1">Emulating a GameBoy Cartridge with an STM32F4. Part 1</a></p>

<p>We have analyzed the memory bus of the GameBoy in order to obtain the timing
information of the different signals involved in the read and write operations
happening on the cartridge. We will now proceed to develop a system to emulate
the behaviour of the cartridge with the STM32F4.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">About voltage levels</h2>

<p>As we noticed in the previous post, the GameBoy works at 5V whereas the STM32F4
works at 3.3V. We saw that most of the GPIOs of the STM32F4 are 5V tolerant, but
they still output 3.3V, so we need to make sure that the GameBoy will detect the
high levels properly. Luckily for us, the GameBoy works at TTL level:
<a href="http://friedtj.free.fr/gb_eng.pdf">source</a>. This means that a 3.3V signal will
be read as a logic 1 by the GameBoy.</p>

<h1 id="toc_1">Setup</h1>

<p>We will use a similar setup here, although now we are going to connect all the
cartridge pins to the STM32F4 so that we can read/write the signals. We have
plenty of GPIOs on the STM32F4-Discovery, we just need to make sure we use the
5V compatible ones. I used the following setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>CLK -&gt; PC0</li>
<li>RD -&gt; PC1</li>
<li>WR -&gt; PC2</li>
<li>DATA{0..7} -&gt; PE{8..15}</li>
<li>ADDR{0..15} -&gt; PD{0..15}</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="toc_2">Coding</h1>

<p>The code of this project can be found in my github page under an open source
license: <a href="https://github.com/Dhole/stm32f_GBCart">github.com/Dhole</a></p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Initialization</h2>

<p>The initialization code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/Dhole/stm32f_GBCart/blob/master/main.c">main.c</a></p>

<p>The first thing to do is to configure the GPIOs of the board. All the GPIOs are
configured as input, push pull mode (will be used when we set the DATA GPIO pins
to output) with pull down resistor (I believe pull down resistor is a good choice
to avoid current drain from the GameBoy(5V) to the STM32F4(3.3V)). The bus for
the GPIOs is configured at 100MHz (maximum frequency available).</p>

<p>This functions can be found in <a href="https://github.com/Dhole/stm32f_GBCart/blob/master/main.c">main.c</a>:</p>

<pre><code>void config_gpio_data();
void config_gpio_addr();
void config_gpio_sig();
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, we will configure the CLK to act as a trigger on rise. To do this we
enable an interrupt for the GPIO we connected the CLK to that will execute a
handler for every level rise. In <a href="https://github.com/Dhole/stm32f_GBCart/blob/master/main.c">main.c</a>:</p>

<pre><code>void config_PC0_int(void);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_4">Read/Write handler</h2>

<p>The read/write handler can be found in <a href="https://github.com/Dhole/stm32f_GBCart/blob/master/stm32f4xx_it.c">stm32f4xx_it.c</a></p>

<p>The interrupt handler will be executed every time the CLK level goes high (rise).
It&rsquo;s important to notice that there is some delay between the rise of CLK and
the execution of the handler. This may be because the GPIOs are peripherials that
communicate with the CPU through a bus clocked at 100MHz and also because the
interrupt is generated from a peripherial, and thus takes some time to be
processed by the CPU. This can be observed if you try to write a program that
toggles the output of a GPIO unpon rise of the CLK, and then monitor both signals
in an oscilloscope.</p>

<p>The handler must wait some time until the addresses are ready in the bus. To
perform fine grained waits I use the NOP operation, which wastes one CPU cycle.
After reading the GPIOs connected to the addresses, we check if the operation is
a read or a write by reading the values of the GPIOs connected to RD and WR.</p>

<p>In case of write, we must wait further until the data is available in the bus,
then we can read the GPIOs and perform the write.</p>

<p>In case of the read, we must first set the GPIOs associated with the data as
output (we configured them to be input). Then we can output the data corresponding
to the address, and wait some cycles so that the GameBoy can read the contents.
After this, the GPIOs for data are configured back to input mode (default state).
Leaving the GPIOs of the data in input state as default is necessary because
sometimes the GameBoy will perfom write operations to internal RAM and having
these GPIOs as output will corrut the data sent by the GameBoy.</p>

<p>If you take a look at IRQHandler examples for the STM32F4 you will notice some
differences. The library functions normally used in a handler have been replaced
by the specific operation. This is because calling a function consumes some
cycles (due to the context change) and also they contain asserts to verify the
input, which consumes more cycles. We are short in cycles here, so we try to avoid
all this.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Dhole/ed6cde3ec6b6574e080f.js"></script>

<p>To perform an arbitrary number of NOP operations, I used a macro I found on
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8551418/c-preprocessor-macro-for-returning-a-string-repeated-a-certain-number-of-times">stackoverflow</a>. The C preprocessor doesn&rsquo;t
allow to repeat an operations a number of times.</p>

<p>Finding the proper number of NOP operations at each stage of the operation has
been the most difficult part of the implementation because it needs to be done
with trial and error. Adding a new case to an if statement changes the number of
cycles of the handler, so the number of NOPs may need to be readjusted. More over,
the compilation optimizations are quite unpredictable regarding how many op codes
are used for the code (and thus, how many cycles are spent on the execution), so
a small change can lead to a malfunctioning system.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">MBC1 implementation</h2>

<p>The read and write functions implementing the behaviour of the MBC1 can be found
in <a href="https://github.com/Dhole/stm32f_GBCart/blob/master/stm32f4xx_it.c">stm32f4xx_it.c</a></p>

<p>A detailed explanation of the functionality of the different Memory Block
Controllers can be found in the <a href="http://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki/articles/Memory_Bank_Controllers">GBdevWiki</a></p>

<p>For the read operation, three regions can be accessed. The first one maps to
the first 16KB of the ROM. The second one to the selectable ROM bank. The third
one to the selectable RAM bank, if any:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Dhole/dc998ea525a208987a69.js"></script>

<p>For the write operation, it can happen that it accesses the RAM region, where
it performs a proper read, or it can access three other regions. The first one is
used to select the lower bits of the ROM bank. The second one is used to select the
RAM bank or the upper bits of the ROM bank, depending on the state of a ROM/RAM
mode flag. The third one is to enable or disable the ROM/RAM mode flag. There is also
an initial region to enable or disable the RAM, used by the cartridges to protect
the RAM agains data corruption, but it&rsquo;s not needed here.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Dhole/7417a4095600fe31b1dd.js"></script>

<h3 id="toc_6">ROM and RAM</h3>

<p>In order to allow the program to access to the contents of a ROM, I used the
unix <code>xxd</code> tool to convert the binary file into a C header file containing an array
with the file contents:</p>

<pre><code>cp Tetris.gb rom.gb
xxd -i rom.gb | sed 's/unsigned/unsigned const/g' &gt; tetris_rom.h
rm rom.gb
</code></pre>

<p>The contents of <em>tetris_rom.h</em> will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned const char rom_gb[] = {
  0xc3, 0x0c, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xc3, 0x0c, 0x02, 0xff,
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>For games that use RAM, an array must be allocated on the SMT32F4. For this
purpose, an array of 32KB (Maximum RAM size for MBC1) will be declared:</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t ram[0x8000]; // 32K
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the saved game will only remain as long as the STM32F4 is not powered
off.</p>

<h1 id="toc_10">Conclusions</h1>

<p>Being able to emulate a full cartridge with its RAM and memory banking with an
ARM development board was really awesome. I wasn&rsquo;t sure this was doable, and
hadn&rsquo;t seen anything similar. I don&rsquo;t own any gameboy flashcarts, so being able
to run code on the gameboy from something I built was extremely satisfactory. I
enjoy watching works of demoscene, and with this project I was able to try out
many amazing demos on the GameBoy.</p>

<p>On the technical side, this project took me a few days of fine tunning and
adding capabilites. This was my first time developing on the STM32F4 so I also
spent a few days documenting myself. The biggest issue I have found is the
timing constraints. Adding cases to if statements, changin the order of some
operations, modifying code&hellip; all this modifies the timing of the instructions
generated by the compiler, sometimes not very intuitively due to strong compiler
optimizations. I spent some hours of trial and error checking that all the
operations worked fine. Also you may have noticed that all the code runs inside
the interruption handler. And this handler is triggered at 1MHz! This gives a
tight margin of operation. If the operations inside the interrupt takes too long,
they will mask the next interruption and a following read/write operation (in
case there was one) will be missed, probably crashing the GameBoy. Care must be
taken to not exceed this timing constraint.</p>

<p>In the following post I will write about adding a custom boot logo to the
cartridge emulator. Stay tunned!</p>
