<p>My last post in this series was more than two years ago.  When I started the
series I had an initial plan to test the three most well known BSD operating
systems, and after publishing articles for NetBSD and OpenBSD I soon
started doing my homework with FreeBSD; unfortunately I had a lot of hiccups.
I&rsquo;ve made 4 different attempts at achieving the objectives in this series with
FreeBSD, the last one being last week, and none of them were fully successful.
The reason for trying several times instead of publishing the first result was
to see if some of the issues I encountered were temporary or bugs of a
particular release; but at the end I decided to publish the results I have.</p>

<p><a href="https://harelang.org/">Hare is a new programming language</a> that was <a href="https://harelang.org/blog/2022-04-25-announcing-hare/">announced
in 2022</a> and which was
started by <a href="https://drewdevault.com/">Drew DeValut</a>.  It&rsquo;s currently being
developed openly by a community of contributors.  Here&rsquo;s a description of the
language from the official website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and
robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory management, and a
minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating systems, system
tools, compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high performance
tasks.</p>

<p>This time I have chosen <a href="https://netbsd.org">NetBSD</a>.  I have used NetBSD previously in my Raspberry Pi (the first version).  I had a lot of fun building packages for ARM from the raspberry pi and trying them out (and finding bugs as well).  I remember fondly the regular <a href="https://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-arm/2022/10/26/msg007897.html">status reports</a> made by Jun Ebihara along with raspberry pi images with many packages already installed.  I also remember building a raspberry pi image myself from a Linux host on amd64 using cross-compilation: I was quite impressed with how easy the process was.</p>

<p>The OS analyzed in this post is <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>.  I&rsquo;ve
tried OpenBSD a few times in the past: once as a personal web server on an old
PC, and then as a desktop in a laptop as a secondary system.  That was a few
years ago.  My memories from it are that the system was very clean, everything
worked as expected, the performance was significantly slower than linux and
that I really appreciated all the care the developers put on the security side.</p>

<p>Nowadays we live in a hyperconnected World that relies heavily on Internet
connection for day to day tasks in all levels.  I&rsquo;m not very happy with this
relience of assuming Internet access 24h for everything, as I think it
disempowers the user.</p>
<p>For example, whereas people before used to buy and own media, now they buy a
license to stream such media from the cloud.  This means that the user only has
access to the media as long as the platform exists, and we know that this is no
guarantee for the future.  It also means that the user can&rsquo;t easily share the
media with their friends, that the consumption of the media can only be done in
authorized devices, etc.</p>

Rust to an embedded ARM microcontroller.  I will explain the hardware I chose
to build this portable CHIP-8 device, the Rust libraries I used and I&rsquo;ll give
an overview of how the code is laid out.  I excluded details about hardware
diagrams and explicit mention of how the hardware is connected to each pin
because I&rsquo;m sure the astute reader will be able to figure this out from the
code itself.</p>

        <p>I have recently built a new storage server at home consisting of 6x2TB hard

Alpine Linux, which is a distribution that I really like for its

sshfs is really easy to set up, as you just need to be running an ssh server,
nevertheless it has some disadvantages:</p>

        <p>I have been interested in the topic of emulation for many years; in particular,
game console emulation.  I started playing games under emulators when I was a
teenager and I was fascinated by how a piece of software would let me play a
game in a completely different architecture than the original one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve ever been interested in learning about emulation, maybe you&rsquo;ve
learned about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">CHIP-8</a>; a
specification of a simple virtual machine designed to play 8bit 2D videogames
in the mid 1970s.  The connection between the CHIP-8 and emulation development
is that the specification of the CHIP-8 is very simple and makes the perfect
target for writing your first emulator.  In fact, that&rsquo;s what I did in 2014: I
wrote <a href="https://github.com/Dhole/Chip8-emu">my first emulator</a>, targeting the
CHIP-8 in C++.  Please, don&rsquo;t take that C++ code too seriously!  I&rsquo;ve never
been experienced in C++, and I wasn&rsquo;t very experienced in software development
by then.</p>

<p>For some time I&rsquo;ve been using several unix users for my daily work in my
desktop computer.  After trying out Qubes OS for some time (an OS that achieves
security by compartmentalization: different kinds of activites are performed in
a different VM, isolating the data of each activity from each other), I came
back to GNU/Linux and realized that there&rsquo;s already a security separation in
Unix (albeit not as secure as virtualization as in Qubes): users.</p>
