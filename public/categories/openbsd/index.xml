      <description>This is a blog post in the Collapse Ready Operating System series. Read this post for an introduction.
OpenBSD The OS analyzed in this post is OpenBSD. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried OpenBSD a few times in the past: once as a personal web server on an old PC, and then as a desktop in a laptop as a secondary system. That was a few years ago. My memories from it are that the system was very clean, everything worked as expected, the performance was significantly slower than linux and that I really appreciated all the care the developers put on the security side.</description>
