      <description>Introduction Hare is a new programming language that was announced in 2022 and which was started by Drew DeValut. It&amp;rsquo;s currently being developed openly by a community of contributors. Here&amp;rsquo;s a description of the language from the official website:&#xA;Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory management, and a minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools, compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high performance tasks.</description>

      <description>This post is the continuation of CHIP-8 emulator in Rust. Part 1, please check it if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already!&#xA;In this second part I will explain how I ported the CHIP-8 emulator I built in Rust to an embedded ARM microcontroller. I will explain the hardware I chose to build this portable CHIP-8 device, the Rust libraries I used and I&amp;rsquo;ll give an overview of how the code is laid out.</description>

      <description>I have been interested in the topic of emulation for many years; in particular, game console emulation. I started playing games under emulators when I was a teenager and I was fascinated by how a piece of software would let me play a game in a completely different architecture than the original one.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been interested in learning about emulation, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve learned about the CHIP-8; a specification of a simple virtual machine designed to play 8bit 2D videogames in the mid 1970s.</description>
