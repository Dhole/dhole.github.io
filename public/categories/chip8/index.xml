      <description>This post is the continuation of CHIP-8 emulator in Rust. Part 1, please check it if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already!
In this second part I will explain how I ported the CHIP-8 emulator I built in Rust to an embedded ARM microcontroller. I will explain the hardware I chose to build this portable CHIP-8 device, the Rust libraries I used and I&amp;rsquo;ll give an overview of how the code is laid out.</description>

      <description>I have been interested in the topic of emulation for many years; in particular, game console emulation. I started playing games under emulators when I was a teenager and I was fascinated by how a piece of software would let me play a game in a completely different architecture than the original one.
I&amp;rsquo;ve you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been interested in learning about emulation, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve learned about the CHIP-8; a specification of a simple virtual machine designed to play 8bit 2D videogames in the mid 1970s.</description>
