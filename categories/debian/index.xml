      <title>No more unencrypted emails to gpg contacts</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I have been using mutt for about half a year already and I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with it.
The previous email client I used was Thunderbird (with the Enigmail extension to
handle GPG).  There were two main reasons that made me switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one was that I often would like to check my email while I&amp;rsquo;m offline,
and it seems that Thunderbird is not very good at this.  Sometimes not all my
email would have been downloaded (just the headers), and I also found it
frustrating that after marking more than 50 emails as read while offline, they
would be marked as unread again once I went back online.  With mutt I&amp;rsquo;m using
mbsync (which apparently is faster than offlineimap) to sync my email to a local
folder with a cron job.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue was that I like having many filters, and it was tedious to
customize filters in Thunderbird:  there&amp;rsquo;s no way to copy a filter and modify
it, and there&amp;rsquo;s a limit in the combinations of ANDs and ORs for fields.  I&amp;rsquo;m
using procmail now, which allows me save the filter configuration in plaintext
and define patterns with more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup for mutt took several weeks, but I never felt that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t
accomplish what I wanted (unlike in Thunderbird).  I&amp;rsquo;m using mutt with several
python and bash scripts that I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the reason for this post is an issue that I believe happens in every email
client (or should I say, MUA, to be more precise).  I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it happening to
people using both Thunderbird and mutt, and I bet it has happened in other
cases: sending an email to someone for which you have their GPG key unencrypted
unwillingly.  I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this happening in email replies with several
participants: after a few encrypted messages are exchanged, someone replies in
the clear, quoting all the previous messages.  I tried to avoid this by
configuring mutt to encrypt and sign by default, forcing me to set sign only
manually before sending every email that I can&amp;rsquo;t send encrypted (I&amp;rsquo;d like to
send all my emails encrypted, but not everybody has a GPG key :( ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happened?  I got so used to sending many unencrypted emails that I would
press &amp;ldquo;P S&amp;rdquo; (PGP setting, Sign only) before sending emails as a reflex act.  And
I sent an email unencrypted to a friend for which I have his GPG key :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought: It&amp;rsquo;s a very rare case to want to send an unencrypted email to
someone for which you have their GPG key.  I think extensions like Enigmail
should give you a warning when this happens, to alert you about it.  In my case,
I solved it with a python script that inspects the email, and, if it&amp;rsquo;s
unencrypted and the recipient/s is/are in your GPG keyring it warns you about it
and returns an error.  The script stores a temporary file with the Message-ID so
that if you run it again with the same email it will properly send the email
without returning an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I only needed to configure mutt to use this script as the sendmail command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;per_account:set sendmail  = &amp;quot;$HOME/bin/check-mail-gpg /usr/bin/msmtp -a $my_email&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here goes the python script &lt;code&gt;check-mail-gpg&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#! /usr/bin/python3

import os
import sys
import subprocess
import email.parser
from email.header import decode_header
from email.utils import parseaddr

STATUS_FILE = &#39;/tmp/check-mail-gpg.tmp&#39;

def dec(header):
    head = decode_header(header)
    if len(head) == 1 and head[0][1] == None:
        return head[0][0]
    else:
        return &#39;&#39;.join([h.decode(enc) if enc else h.decode(&#39;ascii&#39;) \
                for (h,enc) in head])

def send_mail(mail):
    print(&#39;Calling external email client to send the email...&#39;)
    #return -1 # testing mode
    p = subprocess.Popen(sys.argv[1:], stdin=subprocess.PIPE)
    p.stdin.write(mail.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;))
    p.stdin.close()
    return p.wait()

def main():
    mail = sys.stdin.read()
    heads = email.parser.Parser().parsestr(mail, headersonly=True)
    content = heads[&#39;Content-Type&#39;].split(&#39;;&#39;)[0].strip()
    print(&#39;Content is:&#39;, content)

    if content == &#39;multipart/encrypted&#39;:
        print(&#39;Ok: encrypted mail, we can return now...&#39;)
        sys.exit(send_mail(mail))

    addrs = [parseaddr(addr) for addr in heads[&#39;To&#39;].split(&#39;,&#39;)]
    print(&#39;Found emails:&#39;, addrs)

    gpg_cnt = 0
    for name, addr in addrs:
        print(&#39;Looking for&#39;, addr, &#39;in the keyring...&#39;)
        res = subprocess.call([&#39;gpg&#39;, &#39;--list-keys&#39;, addr],
                stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        if res == 0:
            gpg_cnt += 1

    if gpg_cnt == 0:
        print(&#39;Ok: no email found in the gpg keyring, we can return now...&#39;)
        sys.exit(send_mail(mail))

    if not os.path.exists(STATUS_FILE):
        open(STATUS_FILE, &#39;w&#39;).close()

    msg_id = heads[&#39;Message-ID&#39;]
    msg_id_prev = &#39;&#39;
    with open(STATUS_FILE, &#39;r&#39;) as f:
        msg_id_prev = f.read()

    if msg_id.strip() == msg_id_prev.strip():
        sys.exit(send_mail(mail))
    else:
        with open(STATUS_FILE, &#39;w&#39;) as f:
            f.write(msg_id)
        print(&#39;Alert: trying to send an unencrypted email to&#39;, addrs,
                &#39;, for which some gpg keys were found in the keyring!&#39;)
        print(&#39;Try again if you are sure to send this message unencrypted.&#39;)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
    main()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;Update&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been told about the option &lt;code&gt;crypt_opportunistic_encrypt&lt;/code&gt; in mutt, which
provides a feature very similar to what I was looking for.  This option will
automatically enable encryption when the recipient has a GPG key in your
keyring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From mutt&amp;rsquo;s man page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.41. crypt_opportunistic_encrypt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type: boolean Default: no&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting this variable will cause Mutt to automatically enable and disable
encryption, based on whether all message recipient keys can be located by
mutt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this option is enabled, mutt will determine the encryption setting each
time the TO, CC, and BCC lists are edited. If $edit_headers is set, mutt will
also do so each time the message is edited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is set, encryption settings can&amp;rsquo;t be manually changed. The pgp or
smime menus provide an option to disable the option for a particular message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If $crypt_autoencrypt or $crypt_replyencrypt enable encryption for a message,
this option will be disabled for the message. It can be manually re-enabled in
the pgp or smime menus. (Crypto only)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Reproducible builds on Debian for GSoC 2015, 1st update</title>
      <link>https://lizard.kuasuka.com/blog/post/reproducible_builds_debian_gsoc2015_update_1/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This is the second blog post I&amp;rsquo;m writing about my experiences contributing to Debian for Google Summer of Code 2015 (check my &lt;a href=&#34;https://lizard.kuasuka.com/blog/post/reproducible_builds_debian_gsoc2015/&#34;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;status-update&#34;&gt;Status update&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-month&#34;&gt;First month&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been two months and a few days since the GSoC started. During the first month I worked on fixing specific packages, mainly concerning issues with timestamps, which is a very common source of unreproducibility. In many cases, during the build process files are compressed into gzip or zip archives, which store the creation time of files in the metadata. This can lead to unreproducible results when there is timezone variation between builds (easily fixed setting the timezone to UTC before the compression happens). In some cases the compressed files are generated during the build, and thus add build times in the metadata of compressed files (in this case the creation date of the files needs to be normalized somehow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2015/StudentApplications/EduardSanou&#34;&gt;application&lt;/a&gt;, I finished exams on the end of June, that&amp;rsquo;s why I chose to work on small fixes first, so that I could make the most out of my time between studying and finishing university projects and reports.
I&amp;rsquo;m happy with my first month, as I have worked as originally planned. Actually, my estimation of the number of bugs I could submit every week was surpassed in reality!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;second-month&#34;&gt;Second month&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the university was over, I started dedicating myself fully to the project. This allowed me to start working on toolchain fixes, following my original plan on working with timestamp related issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular I have been working a lot in implementing a &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/TimestampsProposal&#34;&gt;proposal for deterministic timestamps&lt;/a&gt; that appeared in the reproducible builds project. The idea is to define an environment variable called &lt;code&gt;SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH&lt;/code&gt; that contains a known timestamp in Unix epoch format. With this variable exported, tools that would embed the localtime in their generated or processed files, can use this externally supplied date. This would happen only if &lt;code&gt;SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH&lt;/code&gt; is exported, so the behaviour of the tool wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change if the variable is not set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first package I patched to implement this behaviour was &lt;a href=&#34;https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2015-06/msg02210.html&#34;&gt;gcc&lt;/a&gt;. The reason behind this is that there are about 420 unreproducible packages due to using the &lt;code&gt;__DATE__&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;__TIME__&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__TIMESTAMP__&lt;/code&gt; C macros. My patch changes the behavior of the macros &lt;code&gt;__DATE__&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__TIME__&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH&lt;/code&gt; is exported. I submitted this patch to the gcc-patches list. Even though there was some interesting discussions in the list, the patch has not been accepted yet. Seeing how the reproducible builds idea is gaining momentum and becoming widespread, I&amp;rsquo;m positive that at some point the gcc people will be more receptive for such patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second work with &lt;code&gt;SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH&lt;/code&gt; was in &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/791823&#34;&gt;debhelper&lt;/a&gt;; I patched this building tool to export the variable with the latest debian/changelog entry timestamp. With this patch, all the tools that run under dh will be able to use it to embed deterministic timestamps. Unfortunately some parts of the build process of some packages don&amp;rsquo;t happen under debhelper, so the variable needs to be exported in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having submitted the debhelper patch allowed many packages to become reproducible after the tools that embedded timestamps were patched to honour &lt;code&gt;SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH&lt;/code&gt;. As of today, the toolchain packages I have patched to do that are: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2015-06/msg02210.html&#34;&gt;gcc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/791815&#34;&gt;libxslt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/792687&#34;&gt;gettext&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/794004&#34;&gt;ghostscript&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/794681&#34;&gt;qt4-x11 (qhelpgenerator)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also continued working on fixing individual packages affected by timestamps, random orderings (such as the ones from listing hash keys) and locale depending orderings; I have tagged packages in our infrastructure to note what kind of issue makes them unreproducible; I have updated some parts of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds&#34;&gt;Reproducible Builds Wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;impressions-about-reproducible-builds&#34;&gt;Impressions about reproducible builds&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work I did during the first month felt a bit tedious sometimes: it didn&amp;rsquo;t require much creativity or thinking as most of the fixes where quite mechanical, following a recipe. After I became free from university duties, I started looking into less trivial issues, which require more deep investigation and feel more rewarding once they are fixed. I also worked on toolchain fixes, which need more work and need more care. Fixing toolchain packages feels particularly rewarding because they can cause many packages to become reproducible at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a very active community in the reproducible builds project! It&amp;rsquo;s great to see so many people contributing to this project spending so many hours and putting so much effort. I&amp;rsquo;ve felt very welcome from the beginning and I have gotten kind replies and helpful answers to all the questions and doubts I&amp;rsquo;ve had, both from my mentor and from the other people in the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to add that I&amp;rsquo;m still amazed by the awesome infrastructure set up for the reproducible builds project. The team is using a Jenkins machine to continuously build packages to check for reproducibility, with irc notifications for changes, and also with a really useful web interface to list all the packages organized by issues that allows exploring them individually with all the available information. Also not only the infrastructure is used to build Debian amd64 packages, but also FreeBSD, NetBSD, &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible.debian.net/openwrt/openwrt.html&#34;&gt;OpenWRT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible.debian.net/coreboot/coreboot.html&#34;&gt;coreboot&lt;/a&gt; and lately Debian armhf with the help of a few new arm nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;impressions-about-working-on-a-free-software-project&#34;&gt;Impressions about working on a free software project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first time working on a community driven free software project and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so many things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I learned during the first days, which is even more present in such wide project like the reproducible builds, is that contributing is not just writing patches for the features you want; you also need to convince the maintainer of the package to accept the patch! I was a bit surprised at the beginning because even if this is a Debian project, that aims to make changes to the whole distribution, decisions are not absolute for the whole Debian project. After taking decisions within the reproducible builds teams on how to approach things, we need to convince the rest of the Debian developers (mainly maintainers) to follow them, as they are allowed to disagree. So it is required to work together for solutions that makes everyone comfortable, usually with discussions on mailing lists or irc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another fact that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting before getting involved in this project. The kind of teamwork I have done previously involves having a leader who decides how stuff is done, who takes decisions when needed and oversees the whole project. There seems to be a different philosophy in Debian. Instead of having a leader, everyone tries their best, trying to convince the others that their solution is good, often by showing an implementation of the solution and providing proof that it works, rather than trying to get the solution accepted before coding it. Also, solutions and ideas are valued for their quality rather than by the position of the person submitting them, and there is no hierarchy within the group: all comments and advices are taken equally, valuing their usefulness regardless of who gives them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually there are no votes when deciding things. Members try their best on their approaches, trying to convince others as best as they can. And even if someone disagrees they may end up accepting the solution if they don&amp;rsquo;t manage to convince the original proposer of doing things differently. The idea is to spend more time working and coding than arguing and deciding on the way to do things. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this approach to be very efficient :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been told by my mentor that for difficult cases there exist a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debian.org/devel/tech-ctte&#34;&gt;Debian committee&lt;/a&gt; that helps mediate on disagreements, but that is only used as a last option, probably when the discussion gets heated up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-experience&#34;&gt;Personal experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I&amp;rsquo;m very happy to finally having set my foot in the free software community, where I&amp;rsquo;m able to contribute to the kind of software I have been using for years. The sense of community in Debian is really big, and everyone is invited to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that Google is doing an awesome job with the Google Summer of Code, not only because it gives a lot to free software but because it helps students to join the free software world as contributors (which is something that may be difficult to get into when you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to begin, as it happened to myself for some time). I plan to continue contributing to the free software world, and I&amp;rsquo;d encourage anyone to find projects to get involved and contribute as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy hacking to everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This is the first blog post of a series I will be writing about my experiences contributing to Debian for Google Summer of Code 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-bit-about-myself&#34;&gt;A bit about myself&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Spanish student doing a master&amp;rsquo;s in Computer Science in Barcelona. I graduated on Electrical Engineering (we call it Telecommunications here). I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in computing and programming and I have worked on several projects on my own using C, python and go. My main interests in the field are programming languages, security, cryptography, distributed and decentralized systems and embedded systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an advocate of free software, I try to use it as much as I&amp;rsquo;m able to in my devices and also try to convince my friends and family of its benefits. I have been using GNU/Linux for nearly ten years as my main operating system and I have tried several *BSD&amp;rsquo;s recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my latest personal projects is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Dhole/miniBoy&#34;&gt;gameboy emulator&lt;/a&gt; written in C (still work in progress) which already plays many games (without sound though) . You can find other minor projects in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Dhole&#34;&gt;github page&lt;/a&gt; (I try to publish all the code I write online, under free software licence)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After so many years of using free software and benefiting from it, I thought it was about time to contribute back! That&amp;rsquo;s why I gave GSoC a try and applied to work on the Reproducible Builds project for Debian :) And I got accepted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;reproducible-builds&#34;&gt;Reproducible Builds&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this project is that currently many packages aren&amp;rsquo;t built in a reproducible manner; that is, they contain timestamps, building machine name, unique IDs, and results from other processes that happen differently between machines, like file ordering in compressed files. The project aims to patch all the Debian packages / the building scripts in order to generate the same binary (bit by bit) independently of the machine, timezone, etc where it is built. This way, a cryptographic hash of the built package can be distributed and many people can rebuild the package to verify that the binary in the repositories indeed corresponds to the right source code by means of comparing the hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main advantages of the free software is that source code is available for peer review. This makes it easier for users to trust their software, as they can check the source to verify that the program is not doing anything bad. Even if the user doesn&amp;rsquo;t do that, they can trust the wider community with that task. But many distributions serve packages in binary form, so how do we know that the binary comes from the publicly available source code? The current solution is that the developers who build the packages sign them cryptographically; but this lands all the trust to the developer and the machines used for building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became interested in this topic with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pAen7beYNc&#34;&gt;very nice talk&lt;/a&gt; given at 31c3 by Mike Perry from Tor and Seth Schoen from the EFF. They focused on reproducible builds applied to the tor browser bundle, showing a small demo of how a building machine could be compromised to add hidden functionalities when compiling code (so that the developer could be signing a compromised package without their knowledge).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;benefits&#34;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main groups who benefit with reproducible builds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;for-users&#34;&gt;For users&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user can be more secure when installing packages in binary form since they don&amp;rsquo;t need to trust a specific developer or building machine. Even if they don&amp;rsquo;t rebuild the package by themselves to verify it, there would be others doing so, who will easily alert the community when the binary doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;for-developers&#34;&gt;For developers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developer no longer has the responsibility of using his identity to sign the package for wide distribution, nor is that much responsible of the damage to users if their machine is compromised to alter the building process, since the community will easily detect it and alert them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This later point is specially useful with secure and privacy aware software. The reason is that there are many powerful organizations around the world with interest on having backdoors in widely used software, be it to spy on users or to target specific groups of people. Considering the amount of money these organizations have for such purposes, it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to imagine that they could try to blackmail developers into adding such backdoors on the built packages. Or they could try to compromise the building machine. With reproducible builds the developer is safer, as such attack is no longer useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;reproducible-builds-in-debian&#34;&gt;Reproducible Builds in Debian&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; kicked-off at Debian at mid 2013 , leaded by Lunar and soon followed by many other developers (h01ger, deki, mapreri, &amp;hellip;). Right now about 80% of the packages in the unstable branch of Debian can be built reproducibly. The project is very active, with many developers sending &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?usertag=reproducible-builds@lists.alioth.debian.org&#34;&gt;patches&lt;/a&gt; every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A machine running &lt;a href=&#34;https://reproducible.debian.net/reproducible.html&#34;&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; (which was set up at the end of 2012 for other purposes) is being used since late 2014 to continuously build packages in different settings to check if they are built reproducibly or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to analyze why packages fail to build reproducibly, a tool called &lt;strong&gt;debbindiff&lt;/strong&gt; has been developed, which is able to output in text or html form a smart diff of two builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tool called &lt;strong&gt;strip-nondeterminism&lt;/strong&gt; has been developed to remove non-determinism from files during the building process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this GSoC I plan on helping improving these tools (mainly debbindiff), write many patches to achieve reproducibility in more packages and write documentation about it. Some of the packages fail to build reproducibly due to specifics of their building processes, whereas others fail due to the usage of toolchains that add non-determinism. I&amp;rsquo;ll focus more on the later ones in order to improve the state more packages. akira will also be working on this project for this GSoC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I just want to add that I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to contribute to Debian, meet the community and learn more about the internals of this awesome distribution!&lt;/p&gt;
