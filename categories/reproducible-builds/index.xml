      <description>This is the second blog post I&amp;rsquo;m writing about my experiences contributing to Debian for Google Summer of Code 2015 (check my first post)
Status update First month It&amp;rsquo;s been two months and a few days since the GSoC started. During the first month I worked on fixing specific packages, mainly concerning issues with timestamps, which is a very common source of unreproducibility. In many cases, during the build process files are compressed into gzip or zip archives, which store the creation time of files in the metadata.</description>

      <description>This is the first blog post of a series I will be writing about my experiences contributing to Debian for Google Summer of Code 2015.
A bit about myself I&amp;rsquo;m a Spanish student doing a master&amp;rsquo;s in Computer Science in Barcelona. I graduated on Electrical Engineering (we call it Telecommunications here). I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in computing and programming and I have worked on several projects on my own using C, python and go.</description>
