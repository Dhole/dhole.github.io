      <description>I have been interested in the topic of emulation for many years; in particular, game console emulation. I started playing games under emulators when I was a teenager and I was fascinated by how a piece of software would let me play a game in a completely different architecture than the original one.
I&amp;rsquo;ve you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been interested in learning about emulation, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve learned about the CHIP-8; a specification of a simple virtual machine designed to play 8bit 2D videogames in the mid 1970s.</description>
