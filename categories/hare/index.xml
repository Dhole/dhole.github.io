      <description>Introduction Hare is a new programming language that was announced in 2022 and which was started by Drew DeValut. It&amp;rsquo;s currently being developed openly by a community of contributors. Here&amp;rsquo;s a description of the language from the official website:&#xA;Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory management, and a minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools, compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high performance tasks.</description>
