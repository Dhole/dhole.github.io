      <description>I had been planning on creating a blog to write about the stuff I do on my free time for a while. In this blog I plan to write about the projects I develop as well as talking about interesting things I lean about technology, hardware, security, embedded systems, programming languages and more.
My first thought was to use a WordPress hosted at wordpress.com, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want the adds. I searched on the net for alternatives and found out about the static website generators, which allow you to host the content in a static web server such as your github personal page.</description>
