      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had been planning on creating a blog to write about the stuff I do on my free time for a while.
In this blog I plan to write about the projects I develop as well as talking about interesting things
I lean about technology, hardware, security, embedded systems, programming languages and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to use a WordPress hosted at wordpress.com, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want the adds. I searched
on the net for alternatives and found out about the static website generators, which allow you to host
the content in a static web server such as your github personal page. Right now this blog is posted in
my server, but I may move it to github if there is some traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform choosen is &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;: a static website engine written in Go. There were
other options such as Jekyll and Oktopress, but I decided to try this one because I love Go and because
it&amp;rsquo;s really fast at generating the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you arround!&lt;/p&gt;
