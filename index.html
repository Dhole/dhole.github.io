        Introduction I&rsquo;m currently setting up a Raspberry Pi 2 as a home server for various services. I&rsquo;m gonna write a series of blog posts about how I configured my Raspberry Pi to achieve my goals, which will be mainly setting up a git server and a backup server. Choice of distribution I discovered Alpine Linux while searching lightweight distributions for the Raspberry Pi. This is a lovely small Linux distribution: one of the first things I noticed is how fast it runs on the RPi due to using a ram filesystem by default; this is specially noticeable in the RPi because usualy the operating system resides in the micro-SD card, which usually offers really slow read and write operations.

        I have been using mutt for about half a year already and I&rsquo;m very happy with it. The previous email client I used was Thunderbird (with the Enigmail extension to handle GPG). There were two main reasons that made me switch. The first one was that I often would like to check my email while I&rsquo;m offline, and it seems that Thunderbird is not very good at this. Sometimes not all my email would have been downloaded (just the headers), and I also found it frustrating that after marking more than 50 emails as read while offline, they would be marked as unread again once I went back online.

        This is the second blog post I&rsquo;m writing about my experiences contributing to Debian for Google Summer of Code 2015 (check my first post) Status update First month It&rsquo;s been two months and a few days since the GSoC started. During the first month I worked on fixing specific packages, mainly concerning issues with timestamps, which is a very common source of unreproducibility. In many cases, during the build process files are compressed into gzip or zip archives, which store the creation time of files in the metadata.

A bit about myself I&rsquo;m a Spanish student doing a master&rsquo;s in Computer Science in Barcelona. I graduated on Electrical Engineering (we call it Telecommunications here). I&rsquo;ve always been interested in computing and programming and I have worked on several projects on my own using C, python and go.

        In this post I will explain the procedure I followed to have an Arch Linux install on a Samsung Chromebook 1 (XE303C12-A01US) with full disk encryption using kernel 3.8. Kernel compilation and preparing SD card Install dependencies Install the necessary depdendencies (In my case I was running ubuntu). Mainly you need the tools for crosscompiling the kernel, configure u-boot and partition the SD card with a GPT partition table. sudo apt-get install u-boot-tools gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf \ binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf cgpt device-tree-compiler Set up some directories and download arch and kernel sources TMP_PATH=$(pwd)/chromeos mkdir -p $TMP_PATH cd $TMP_PATH mkdir -p root mkdir -p mnt Download my custom files git clone https://github.com/Dhole/alarm_install.git .

        With the cartridge emulator implemented on an STM32F4 we can do some cool stuff. For example, we can make the GameBoy boot with our own custom logo! Bootstrap ROM When the GameBoy boots, an intenral Bootstrap ROM is mapped to the beginning of the memory and execution begins. This bios is in charge of initializing the hardware as well as scrolling the Nintendo logo and checking that the cartridge i valid.

        This post is a continuation of Emulating a GameBoy Cartridge with an STM32F4. Part 1 We have analyzed the memory bus of the GameBoy in order to obtain the timing information of the different signals involved in the read and write operations happening on the cartridge. We will now proceed to develop a system to emulate the behaviour of the cartridge with the STM32F4. About voltage levels As we noticed in the previous post, the GameBoy works at 5V whereas the STM32F4 works at 3.3V.

        Introduction The following project consists on emulating the functionality of a GameBoy cartridge with the development board STM32F4. The system is fully functional and is able to emulate real cartridges (as well as homebrew games) of the type ROM Only and MBC1 (Memory Block Controller 1). In this post I will explain how I managed to achieve this. Motivation Current flashcart systems commonly use a design consisting on a FPGA or CPLD controlling the logic of the emulated cartridge (memory banking, RAM access, etc.), a media storage (flash chip or SD card) and an SDRAM chip.

        I had been planning on creating a blog to write about the stuff I do on my free time for a while. In this blog I plan to write about the projects I develop as well as talking about interesting things I lean about technology, hardware, security, embedded systems, programming languages and more. My first thought was to use a WordPress hosted at wordpress.com, but I didn&rsquo;t want the adds. I searched on the net for alternatives and found out about the static website generators, which allow you to host the content in a static web server such as your github personal page.
